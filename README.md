# Athena - Alexa voice controlled home automation using NodeMCU(ESP8266) #

## Inspired by [TheMakersWorkBench](http://themakersworkbench.com/tutorial/how-diy-home-automation-nodemcu-amazon-alexa) ##

It creates four FauxMo smart-home devices(Light, night lamp, fan, workstation for me change em as you wish) that emulates Belkin We-Mo switches.
